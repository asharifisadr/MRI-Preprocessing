# MRI-Preprocessing
This repository contains a Python script for preprocessing NIfTI-format brain MRI images from ADNI dataset. The preprocessing pipeline includes bias field correction, skull stripping, registration to MNI space, and intensity normalization. This script is designed to streamline the preprocessing of neuroimaging data for downstream analysis.
